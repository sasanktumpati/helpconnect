# HelpConnect

A unified platform that connects NGOs, Charities, Individuals, MNCs, Corporations, and small organizations to provide community aid, donations, and disaster relief when it matters most.

## Inspiration

During our volunteering experience, we witnessed firsthand the real challenges involved in creating social impact. We quickly realized there was a major disconnect in the giving ecosystem—donation supply and demand were poorly coordinated, and most NGOs worked in isolation without effective systems to manage donations or reach those who needed help the most.

Large corporations, colleges, and schools often chose to donate to well-known NGOs with an established presence. As a result, smaller, local NGOs remained overlooked, despite working tirelessly at the grassroots level.

On the other side, many people in rural and semi-urban areas didn't even know NGOs could help them. Take this real example: A caretaker at a small old-age home needed mattresses but had no way of reaching any NGO. He lacked contacts, access, and time.

That's where our idea was born.

We envisioned a simple, universal platform where:

* Anyone can post a donation—be it a corporation or an individual.
* Any orphanage, school, or small hospital can search for and connect with an NGO offering exactly what they need.
* Everyone involved can track, verify, and mobilize support quickly and transparently.

## What it does

HelpConnect serves as a multifaceted platform that enables:

- **Campaign Creation & Donations**: Users can create fundraising campaigns for causes they care about and receive monetary donations from supporters.
- **Item Donations**: A marketplace for donating physical items to those in need, reducing waste and ensuring resources reach those who can use them.
- **Help Requests**: Individuals can post specific requests for assistance, whether it's for services, items, or other forms of support.
- **Community Drives**: Organizations can coordinate community-wide initiatives to address specific needs or causes.
- **Organization Directory**: A comprehensive listing of verified non-profits and community organizations to facilitate partnerships and support.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Campaign creators and organizations can track the impact of their initiatives through detailed analytics.
- **Notification System**: Users receive real-time updates about their campaigns, donations, and community activities.

## How we built it

- **Frontend**: Next.js with the App Router for server-side rendering
- **UI Framework**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Serverless architecture with Next.js API routes and server actions
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL for robust data storage and retrieval
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for secure user authentication and authorization
- **Deployment**: Vercel

We implemented a modular component architecture that allows for easy maintenance and feature expansion.
